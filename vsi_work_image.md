First, go to the devices menu and make sure that you have the correct account permissions to complete the tasks.

* Go to your console's device menu. For more information, see [Going to devices](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-navigating-devices).
* Make sure that you have any necessary account permissions and device access. Only the account owner, or a user with the `Manage users` classic infrastructure permission, can adjust the permissions.

For more information about permissions, [Managing device access](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-managing-device-access).

## Accessing image templates
{: #accessing-image-templates}

Complete the following steps to access image templates in your console.

1. From the **Devices** menu, select **Manage > Images**.
2. On the *Image Templates* screen, you see all of the private images that are associated with the account. Any interactions with private images happen here. You can also access public images by clicking the **Private Images** drop-down selector and choosing **Public Images** instead.

For more information about image templates, see [Getting started with image templates](/docs/image-templates?topic=image-templates-getting-started-with-image-templates#getting-started-with-image-templates).
