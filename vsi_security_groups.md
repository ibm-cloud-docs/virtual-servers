# Security groups
{: #security-groups}

With security groups for {{site.data.keyword.BluVirtServers}}, you can enact a set of IP filter rules that define how to handle incoming and
outgoing traffic to both the public and private interfaces of a virtual server instance. A security group creates a sort of virtual firewall.
