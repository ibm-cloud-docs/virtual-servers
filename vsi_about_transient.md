# Transient virtual servers
{: #about-vs-transient}

The {{site.data.keyword.BluVirtServers}} transient offering is a good option if you have flexible workloads and want cost savings. You save money by running your workload on a transient virtual server. Transient instances are provisioned when unused capacity available is available. Therefore, when data center resources are needed for full, on-demand accounts, you can also lose those resources. Transient instances are de-provisioned on a first-on, first-off basis when those resources need to be reclaimed.   

Transient virtual servers offer the following flexibility:

* **Global availability**

   The transient virtual server offering is available in data centers across the globe.

* **Cost savings**

   Transient virtual servers are ideal for non-production workloads. For example, you might use a transient instance to test and develop applications, or test scalability in environments that don't require constant uptime.

Transient instances are public instances that use SAN-backed storage. The following families of public instances are available for this offering.

| Families  | Description                                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| [Balanced](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-about-virtual-server-profiles#balanced) | Best for common cloud workloads that require a balance of performance and scalability. Uses network-attached storage.|
| [Compute](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-about-virtual-server-profiles#compute) | Best for moderate to high web traffic workloads.|
| [Memory](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-about-virtual-server-profiles#memory)  | Best for memory caching and real-time analytics workloads. |

## Notifications
{: #notifications-transient-virtual-servers}

When configured, you can receive automated reclaim notifications that help you prepare and reduce lost data. For more information, see [Configuring automated reclaim notifications](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-configuring-notifications-for-reclaims-of-transient-virtual-servers#configuring-notifications-for-reclaims-of-transient-virtual-servers).  

## Limitations
{: #limitations-transient-virtual-servers}

Consider the following limitations before you provision a transient virtual server.

* The number of supported, concurrent instances are part of your account-wide device quota. For more information about concurrent instance limits, see [FAQ: Virtual servers](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-faqs-virtual-servers#faqs-virtual-servers).
* Transient instances cannot be upgraded or downgraded.
* Resources can be reclaimed at any time, without notification.
* Transient instances cannot use local storage.
* Transient instances cannot use GPU-based or variable compute profiles.


## Next steps
