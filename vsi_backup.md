Continuous Data Protection is a high-performance backup software from R1Soft&reg; that is used for backup of both physical and virtual devices. Continuous Data Protection consists of three main components: the R1Soft&reg; server, the agent, and the database plug-ins, which are available for purchase separately from the first two components. Because R1Soft&reg; Continuous Data Protection is a third-party backup solution, interactions with Continuous Data Protection take place entirely outside of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} proprietary interfaces. However, R1Soft&reg; Continuous Data Protection passwords can be tracked and stored within {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console. All other interactions with R1Soft&reg; Continuous Data Protection are documented on the R1Sof&reg; website.
