# Running a vulnerability scan
{: #virtual-server-v-scans}

You can run a vulnerability scan for any of your servers. A vulnerability scan attempts to find potential security problems on a server by first searching for open ports and the services that run on them. If any services are found, the scanner checks for version and patch information of each service found. The scanner also uses the information that is gathered to search its database of known vulnerabilities and generate a report. Reports typically take five to ten minutes to run but allow for up to thirty minutes in rare cases.

This feature was deprecated on 19 July 2020. After this date, you can't conduct any vulnerability scans from the Nessus Security Scanner within the IBM Cloud console. For more information, see [FAQs: Nessus end of service](/docs/cloud-infrastructure?topic=cloud-infrastructure-monitoring-faq-2).

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin-running-vulnerability-scan}

First, navigate to the device menu and ensure you have the correct account permissions to complete the task. 

* Go to your console's device menu. For more information, see [Navigating to devices](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-navigating-devices).
* Make sure that you have any necessary account permissions and device access. Only the account owner, or a user with the **Manage Users** classic infrastructure permission, can adjust the permissions. 

For more information about permissions, see [Classic infrastructure permissions](/docs/account?topic=account-infrapermission) and [Managing device access](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-managing-device-access).

## Running a vulnerability scan
{: #running-a-vulnerability-scan}

A vulnerability report typically includes the following information:

* Number of security holes and warnings
* The hosts that were scanned
* The port or service and the corresponding issue
* Detailed information about the issue, risk factor, and possible fixes

If you have a firewall, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} administrative networks need permissions for an effective vulnerability scan. If a firewall is blocking all ports, the report might not show any problems even if some exist. In addition, you might have some indication in your firewall logs of a scan that is taking place as ports on your system are investigated.

To run a vulnerability scan, complete the following steps.

1. From the **Devices** menu, select **Device List**.
2. From the **Device List**, select a device that you want to scan.
3. Click the **Security** tab to view current security details.
4. Click **Scan**.
