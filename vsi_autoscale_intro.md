# Managing servers with auto scaling
{: #managing-servers-with-auto-scaling}

Auto scale provides you with the ability to automate the manual scaling process that is associated with adding or removing virtual servers to support your business applications. Auto scaling can be managed through the API or {{site.data.keyword.slportal_full}} and enables the following:

* Seamless and automatic scaling up of virtual servers when more resources are required due to demand.
* Seamless and automatic scaling down of virtual servers by removing unnecessary resources when demand goes down (saving you money).
* Flexible scaling triggers, including CPU percentage being used, outgoing public and private bandwidth, and incoming public and private bandwidth.
* Near-real-time status updates for scaling activity in groups.
* Optional integration of virtual LAN (VLAN) and local load balancers.
