# Viewing and managing device user names and passwords
{: #view-update-user-name-password-for-device}

From the device details page, you can view existing user names and passwords on a device and update them to new values.

## Before you begin
{: #view-update-user-name-password-for-device-before-you-begin}
First, navigate to the device menu and ensure you have the correct account permissions to complete the tasks. 

* Navigate to your console's device menu. For more information, see [Navigating to devices](/docs/vsi?topic=virtual-servers-navigating-devices).
* Ensure you have any necessary account permissions and device access. Only the account owner, or a user with the **Manage Users** classic infrastructure permission, can adjust the permissions. 

For more information about permissions, see [Classic infrastructure permissions](/docs/iam?topic=iam-infrapermission#infrapermission) and [Managing device access](/docs/vsi?topic=virtual-servers-managing-device-access).
