## What if I used custom images with Advanced Monitoring by Nimsoft?
{: #what-if-i-use-custom-images-with-nimsoft}
{: faq}

To simplify this transition, {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} automatically removed the "Advanced Monitoring" attribute from all of your custom images to prevent provisioning failures after **8 May 2020** when Advanced Monitoring by Nimsoft is no longer available. By removing this attribute, you can continue to use custom images without interruption. If you want to continue with resource monitoring, you need to manually install {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} after a new resource is provisioned.
