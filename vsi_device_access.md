# Managing device access
{: #managing-device-access}

To access and manage the details for a specific device, you needthe correct permissions.  After the account administrator grants your user account access to a device, you can view the device details by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console or by using the {{site.data.keyword.slapi_short}}. The information or actions that you see depend on the device type, and the permissions that are granted to your user account.
{: shortdesc}

If your account has devices to that you don't have access, you see an "Unknown Device" name when you try to access those devices.
{: note}

You can assign device access to any users on your account, but not to yourself. Only an account's administrator has access to all devices on their customer account and can set access for all other users on their account. 

You must have the following permissions to access the device details for public virtual servers or dedicated virtual servers.

* **View Virtual Servers Details** - Used to view the IP addresses, operating system type, passwords, and more for a given virtual server.  IView Virtual Servers Details is also used to update virtual server passwords in the portal. You must have this access to view public instances, dedicated instances, and dedicated host instances.

* **View Virtual Dedicated Host Details** - Used to view the IP addresses, operating system type, passwords, and more for a given dedicated host.  View Virtual Dedicated Host Details is also used to migrate dedicated instances to a different dedicated host. You must have this access to view dedicated hosts.
