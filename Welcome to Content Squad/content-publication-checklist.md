## Part 1

* Acrolinx
* Verify links - make sure to use the external link icon for links that leave IBM Cloud Docs site 
* CHKPII
* Accessibility testing (DAP) - https://www.ibm.com/able/dynamic-assessment-plug-in.html
* Peer review - another pair of eyes is always a good idea

## Part 2
* Create PR to move final staging content into GH master
* Merge PR to publish docs into production at GA
* Verify production content and links

## Part 3
* Package and submit content to translation
