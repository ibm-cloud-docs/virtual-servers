# Welcome to the Compute Content Squad!

This guide is intended to provide information pertinent to new developers joining the Compute Content squad. The goal is to quickly integrate new members into the squad and make them contributing developers. The guide familiarizes new squad members with day-to-day operating procedures and outlines prerequisites required to carry out those operations.

## Getting started

Before you can begin your work as a member of the squad, you must have access to the following accounts:

1. IBM Intranet Account
    * [Intranet Home Page](http://w3.ibm.com) - View your "Home Page" for the IBM intranet. A default page is provided until you sign in (see "Intranet ID", below). Consider setting this as your browser's default page.

    * Manage your [Intranet ID](https://w3.ibm.com/profile/update/password/en-us/index.html) - This link is used to change your IBM intranet password, or view other managed IDs assigned to you, such as functional IDs or applications IDs. Consider bookmarking for future reference.

2. GitHub Account- hosting environment for IBM Cloud Docs
    * Staging (Enterprise) - our playground to verify builds, content, and navigation before going live. Open to all IBMers.
    * Production - live for public use
    * For more information, see the [Welcome to GitHub](https://console.stage1.bluemix.net/docs/developing/markdown/markdown.html?pos=2#where-do-i-store-my-markdown-files-welcome-to-github-) content in IBM Cloud Docs.

3. SoftLayer Account
    * See [SoftLayer User Identifiers](sl-user-id.md) for instructions for setting up and managing your SoftLayer accounts.
    * See [SoftLayer VPN](sl-vpn.md) for instructions on how to connect to it.
    * [IBM Cloud Infrastructure customer portal](https://control.softlayer.com/) (SoftLayer Customer Portal) quick link

4. Slack Account
    * Use your IBM intranet account to sign into [Slack](https://ibm.enterprise.slack.com/signin/find-teams/T02J3DPUE) and request access to join the "IBM Watson Cloud Platform" team. After joining, add the following channels, at minimum:

     1. #kkb-team *
     2. #priv_compute_doc_standup *
     3. #priv_compute_docs *
     4. #iaas-compute-docs

   **NOTE:** The channels with a " * " are private channels. Ask Jim Fall or Kim Button for invite to #kkb-team. Ask anyone in our squad for an invite to the other private channels.
