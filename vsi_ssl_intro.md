# SSL certificates
{: #ssl-certificates}

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a technology that encrypts traffic between the client application and the server application that is involved in the conversation. This encryption is accomplished through a public key or private key system by using an SSL certificate.
{: shortdesc}

The SSL certificate contains the serverâ€™s public key, dates for which the certificate is valid, a hostname for which the certificate is valid, and a signature from the certificate authority that issued it. With this information and some protocol information from the beginning of a session, you can be reasonably certain that the server is the one to which it is intending to talk.

For more information about SSL certificates, see [Getting started with SSL certificates](/docs/ssl-certificates?topic=ssl-certificates-getting-started-tutorial#getting-started-tutorial).
