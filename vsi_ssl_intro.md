Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a technology that encrypts traffic between the client application and the server application that is involved in the conversation. This encryption is accomplished through a public key or private key system by using an SSL certificate.
{: shortdesc}

The SSL certificate contains the serverâ€™s public key, dates for the valid certificate, a hostname for the valid certificate is valid, and a signature from the certificate-issuing authority. With this information and some protocol information from the beginning of a session, you can be reasonably certain that the server is the one to which it is intending to talk.
