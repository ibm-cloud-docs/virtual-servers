{: faq}

The estimated usage data is not real-time data for your server. Usage is calculated and stored for the previous day to provide a quick way to monitor and display bandwidth usage. It can be slightly off from the monthly view graphs. The estimated usage data is rounded at daily intervals; whereas, the monthly graphs are rounded at a monthly interval. Additionally, the graph images are showing data usage up to the time when they were displayed, but the estimated totals are only up to midnight of the previous day.

## What is the difference between monthly and billing bandwidth data?

When you purchase your first server or product, you are assigned an anniversary date. All products that are purchased after this date are pro-rated to your anniversary date. The monthly data is displayed off a calendar month; whereas, the billing data is displayed off your anniversary date. All bandwidth billing is calculated based on your anniversary date.
