# Welcome to the compute-content Onboarding Guide

**Purpose:**
This guide is intended to provide information pertinent to new developers joining the compute-content squad.  The goal is to quickly integrate new members into the squad and make them contributing developers.  The guide familiarizes new squad members with day-to-day operating procedure for the squad and outlines pre-reqs required to carry out those operations.

## This guide provides:
- The squad's operating philosophy and playbook
- A description of the squad's agile process and agile principles
- A reference to a set of User IDs, groups, and access permissions that must be established for the new squad member
- A set of commonly used software tools recommended for installation on developer workstations
