# Public virtual servers for Classic
{: #about-public-virtual-servers}

The public {{site.data.keyword.BluVirtServers}} for Classic are IBM-managed, multi-tenant virtual server deployments. They give you rapid scalability and higher-cost effectiveness with pre-defined sizes that meet all business requirements to get you up and running quickly.

{: tip}

Classic public virtual servers have many advantages. The following are some examples.

* **Global availability**
   Classic public virtual servers are available in data centers across the globe.
* **Configuration choices, rapid deployment, and scalability**
   Classic public virtual servers gives you small or large virtual server options to meet various workload requirements.

Through extra configuration, you can improve network performance of Classic virtual servers as compared to using the default settings. For more information, see [Configuring virtual server settings for improved network performance](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-configuring-network-performance). However, the amount of allowable network traffic for public virtual servers, which encompasses virtual server instance SAN and other network-attached storage, has no guarantee. If network traffic of a virtual server instance has a significant, negative impact on other virtual servers, that instance might restart on a new host, or in extreme cases, become disabled. This negative impact is often observed as traffic levels approach 20,000 - 30,000 packets per second (PPS). For guaranteed networking, use of the Dedicated Virtual Server offering is recommended. For more information, see the single-tenant environment, [Dedicated virtual server](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-dedicated-virtual-servers) offering.

The following families of public instances are available for this offering.

| Families | Description |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| [Balanced](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-about-virtual-server-profiles#balanced) | Best for common cloud workloads that require a balance of performance and scalability. Uses network-attached storage. |
| [Balanced local storage](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-about-virtual-server-profiles#balanced-local-storage) | Best for large database workloads that require high I/O performance with low latency. |
| [Variable compute](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-about-virtual-server-profiles#variable-compute)  | Best for workloads that donâ€™t require steady, high-CPU performance. |
| [Compute](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-about-virtual-server-profiles#compute) | Best for moderate to high web traffic workloads.|
| [Memory](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-about-virtual-server-profiles#memory)  | Best for memory caching and real-time analytics workloads. |
| [GPU](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-about-virtual-server-profiles#gpu)  | Best for high-performance workloads.
