# Managing a device in snapshot view
{: #managing-a-device-in-snapshot-view}

From the device list, you can view a limited amount of information, or snapshot, for one or more devices. You can perform multiple actions on a device in snapshot view. The actions include viewing the username and password for the device, adding tags, and viewing tickets.

## Before you begin

First, go to the device menu and ensure you have the correct account permissions to complete the tasks. 

* Go to your console's device menu. For more information, see [Navigating to devices](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-navigating-devices).
* Make sure that you have any necessary account permissions and device access. Only the account owner, or a user with the **Manage Users** classic infrastructure permission, can adjust the permissions. 

For more information about permissions, see [Classic infrastructure permissions](/docs/account?topic=account-infrapermission) and [Managing device access](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-managing-device-access).
