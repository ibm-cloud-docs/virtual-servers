{{site.data.keyword.SendGrid}}, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} email delivery service, is a mail relay service that allows you to use a smart host to relay your outbound mail services. A smart host relays SMTP traffic from an SMTP server, mail client, or any other service or programming language capable of handling SMTP.
