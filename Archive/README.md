# Archived files

This folder is for archived files. 

An archived file must be:
1. Copied into this folder:
    * Provide date of archive in the title of the file
    * Provide date of archive in your update when you commit the change (so it's easily seen without having to go into the file itself)
2. Deleted from the main repository (staging and production)
3. Deleted from the repository's TOC (staging and production)
