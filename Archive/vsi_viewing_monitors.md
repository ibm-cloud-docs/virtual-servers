# ARCHIVED 6/21/19 - Viewing and managing monitors
{: #viewing-and-managing-monitors}

Monitoring a device allows users to initiate service and slow pings to ensure the device is online and responsive.
{: shortdesc}

If an echo is not received in the allotted time frame (1 second for service pings, 5 seconds for slow pings) an alert is sent to the email 
address on the account. A status of **Up** in the **Status** field indicates an echo was received, while **Down**
indicates the echo was not received. If you have already configured a basic monitor, you can follow the steps below to view and manage monitoring for a device.

## Next Steps
   
- If a new monitor has been added, the monitor will appear on the **Monitoring** tab. The monitor will send a ping to the device every five minutes, expecting a response based on the selected ping type. If the expected response is not received, an email is sent to the notification email address for the account in the specified timeframe, if notification has been selected.
- If a monitor has been edited, the monitor will continue to function as specified in the monitor details. If type is changed, the amount of time to receive the expected ping will be different. If notification options changed, the way users will be notified of failed attempts will be changed based on the new selections. The monitor will remain accessible from the **Monitoring** tab.
- If a monitor is removed, the monitor will no longer function for the device. All monitoring associated with the removed monitor will cease and the monitor will no longer appear on the **Monitoring** tab.
