# Viewing portable storage  
{: #view-portable-storage}

Portable storage is an auxillary storage disk that you can detach from one virtual server and attach to another. You can connect portable storage disk to virtual server at a time while all information that is stored on the disk is retained for transfer between devices. Portable storage can be purchased and applied to your virtual server at any time.

First, go to the device menu and make sure that you have the correct account permissions to complete the tasks.

* Go to your device menu. For more information, see [Navigating to devices](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-navigating-devices).
