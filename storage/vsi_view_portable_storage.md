# Viewing portable storage
{: #view-portable-storage}

Portable storage is an auxiliary storage disk that you can detach from one virtual server and attach to another. You can connect a portable storage disk to a virtual server at a time while all information that is stored on the disk is retained for transfer between devices. Portable storage can be purchased and applied to your virtual server at any time.
