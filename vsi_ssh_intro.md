# SSH keys
{: #ssh-keys}

Secure Socket Shell (SSH) is a network protocol that enables a user or client computer to connect, through a secure channel, to a remote computer over the internet and have access to issue commands on the remote computer.

SSH keys are the public-key credentials that are used by the SSH protocol for authentication and encryption.

For more information about SSH keys, see [Getting started with SSH keys](/docs/ssh-keys?topic=ssh-keys-getting-started-tutorial).
